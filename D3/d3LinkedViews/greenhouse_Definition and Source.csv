EN.ATM.GHGT.KT.CE	Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)	"Total greenhouse gas emissions in kt of CO2 equivalent are composed of CO2 totals excluding short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning and Savannah burning) but including other biomass burning (such as forest fires, post-burn decay, peat fires and decay of drained peatlands), all anthropogenic CH4 sources, N2O sources and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs and SF6)."

EN.ATM.METH.KT.CE	Methane emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)	Methane emissions are those stemming from human activities such as agriculture and from industrial methane production.

EN.ATM.CO2E.KT	CO2 emissions (kt)	"Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring."	"Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, United States."
EN.ATM.GHGO.KT.CE	"Other greenhouse gas emissions, HFC, PFC and SF6 (thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent)"	"Other greenhouse gas emissions are by-product emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride."
